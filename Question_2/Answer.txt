The most exciting assignment that I could work on if I will start working at Roambee will be handling the communication between the multiple devices using RTOS with various handshaking procedure. 

For example, if we are designing the Electronic Speedometer for an Vehicle, then it consistantly get the messages from the engine ECU indicating the speed of the engine, it also gets messages that which gear is currently applied to the vehicle. Another message arrived to speedometer could be the rotation per meter from the wheel. Each CAN frame contains various fields having different datas releted to different parameter. The extraction of the all of this messages, from the packets and put together to calculate resultant current information of the speed. This data is calibrated to the angle required to move the coil to display the appropriate speed on the dial. Then the required value of voltage need to move the coil to particular angle is mapped. i.e. angle of the pin on dial is mapped to the corresponding voltage level. This voltage level is decoded into the code which are applied to DAC for voltage generation. And this voltage is then applied to the Amplifier with the gain required for the movement of the pin on the dial.
