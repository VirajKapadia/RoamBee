I am seeing myself after two years in my career in the possition where I am working on the Application Firmware building with the knowledge of how hardware reacts to the code when the code is written in C. Where I am developing the Applications related to the complex communication protocols and handling the communication architecture with various rules. For example, communication protocols used in the CAN communication with handshaking between two units. 

Since good understandability of mine can understand the requirement deeply and convey the same the team. I also seeing myself leading the team of people with least complain in deliverables.
